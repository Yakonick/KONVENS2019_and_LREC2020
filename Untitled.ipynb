Even if the battle short switches were on (over-riding all reactor protective functions) the plants just plain could not make enough power to go a whole lot faster.

I also hope you saw the nice message that I sent you, wishing you a speedy recovery, with a painting that I drew just for you. The painting messed up your page format terribly, but my intentions were good.  \\n\\n Enough with the insincere formalities! LOL Look, Bgwhite, you know the nightmare that several of us went through with the Harp Twins article. I made many mistakes, partly because I was young and stupid, and to some degree because I did feel as if others provoked me, even though I don\\'t claim to be less responsible than them for that disastrous situation. As you know very well, I\\'m in the Wikipedia Sons of B*tches Hall of Shame. Anyway, although I did agree to not edit the article (and I complied for a very long time), I\\'m not a fan of those girls any more, as I told you a few months ago. So at that point I helped Wayzgoose learn how to update the article because I had lost interest (you can see that he has made several edits).  \\n\\n However, I simply could not let the creator of the article (Crowdsalesmed) get away with a recent edit. Oh, by the way, I see a brand new edit from that user now. Crowdsalesmed removed the remarks made by Megan Bledsoe in a thesis for a Doctor\\'s degree in Harp Performance. The reason? The observations are not very flattering. But even when I was a fanatical fan of those girls, I actually was very impressed and pleased when Lesser Cartographies found that reference and added it to the article. The fact that the Harp Twins were mentioned in an academic paper shows more notability, in my opinion, and I thought it was a great contribution to the article. Besides, you don\\'t need me to tell you that an article should show different perspectives about the subject, not just the flattering ones. That\\'s the whole point of the NPOV policy, right? Neutrality. Or else we have a promotional article instead of an encyclopedic article. So I reinserted those observations. Megan Bledsoe is an authority on the subject. Notice in the edit description how Crowdsalesmed mischaracterized Megan Bledsoe to get rid of her. After I reinserted the information, Crowdsalesmed removed it again, this time claiming that I had no right to edit the article because you had blocked me. You can see what I wrote in the edit description when I added the reference a second time. But now that contributor has distorted the reference (introduced by Lesser, as I said), to minimize Bledsoe. Instead of \"\"Music theorist and harpist Megan Bledsoe\"\" it reads \"\"Harp player Megan Bledsoe\"\", and instead of \"\"remarks\"\", it now says \"\"remarked in a personal thesis paper\"\". I think that\\'s massive POV going on. \"\"Personal\"\"? That was for the University of Washington!  \\n\\n I will let you decide what to do with that, although I know you have much catching up to do with your administrative tasks. But really, I couldn\\'t just watch that happen. It would be immoral to do so. Although I had huge disagreements with Lesser and Duff at the time, I do believe that they were essentially trying to keep the article neutral. Perhaps at some point their feelings towards me got in the way a bit, but they both had valid points for sure. I still think Duff should not have come back to the article after voting to delete it, but he didn\\'t break any rules in that sense. If I had not reinserted the Bledsoe remarks, it might seem as if I merely pretended that I was no longer a Harp Twins fan, to then let the article get out of control little by little, more and more promotional, having sort of gotten Lesser and Duff out of the way. That would have made me look despicable. So yes, I edited the article without your permission, but it was to reestablish neutrality by merely reinserting what Lesser had put in there. I did it twice, but Crowdsalesmed can\\'t handle that observation that Bledsoe wrote. I don\\'t want to fight on that article any more. As I said, I have lost interest and I\\'m tired of fighting there. I hope you understand. Could you please add that article to your watchlist again so you can keep it balanced? And please check that last edit, which I already explained to you (Bledsoe is being mischaracterized in the article now, which is worse than doing that in the edit description, of course). I just don\\'t think that\\'s right.              \\n\\n Many thanks, Bgwhite, and I\\'m very glad you\\'re back!   \"',\n",
       " '\"::Hi Muz - you must understand that the reasons a genocide was committed shouldn\\'t make anyone feel better about it having happened, any more than you as a Turk should feel personally guilty for what happened before you were born.  It happened.  The government did something against 2 or more million unarmed Armenian civilians and over half of them died.  While I am happy to hear your specific comments on the article, I insist you go back and read ALL the archived discussions (links available at the top of this page) about the article, before you try to raise issues that we have discussed to death already, and great (and painful) length.  In genocide, like in one on one murder, there are no \"\"two sides to the story\"\".  It is murder.  It is not oh, well he murdered the slave because he was afraid the slave would get away.  It is true this is not pleasant, but it is what happened, and we need to deal with it in an honest and healthy way so that it can be put firmly in the past and life can go on normally.  The Turkish government cannot even bring itself to establish diplomatic relations with Armenia, who has no preconditions itself...  how ridiculous a situation is this?    \\n\\n \"',\n",

Certainly the other option would be to try to set up a disambig. page and have each different reptillian humanoid article have a parenthetic addition to the title to separate them; however, a list seemed more appropriate in the present case. \\n ::::As for your second issue, there was actually very little material in this page on the extraterrestrial, David Icke reptillian humanoid, because of issues with notability and verifiability.  That has been the case for some time on this page, and doesn't really have anything to do with the latest rework.  The relevant material that was here has been moved to reptillian extraterrestrial.  If you feel that more material should be added to that or that it should be moved to a different page name, feel free to contribute there or start a discussion on that talk page.  Certainly reptillian humanoid (extraterrestrial) or reptillian humanoid (conspiracy theory) would seem to be options.\",\n",

The Holy Spirit will come when HE thinks you\\'re ready.

But if you\\'re a child, living under our parents, you can go to heaven (as long as we aren\\'t doing anything really evil, such as murder), but your parents, who have to be true Christians with the Holy Spirit, would have to be praying to God for you to go to heaven.  So if you want the Holy Spirit, all you have to do is try your best to be a Christian and wait.  But sometimes when I pray to God, I ask HIM, \"\"Please give me the Holy Spirit when I\\'m ready.\"\"  I\\'m not sure exactly how you\\'ll know when you have the Holy Spirit, but my mommy says that you\\'ll find comfort with God and being more Christian.

I propose changing our section to reflect what is on the fetal pain page.  The following is taken from the fetal pain page directly (though edited for summary form):\\n\\nFetal pain, its existence, and its implications are debated politically and academically, particularly in regards to the abortion debate.  \\n\\nA 2005 American study, conducted by neurobiologists and pediatricians concluded that \"\"...fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester. Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques.\"\"\"\"Fetal Pain: A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence\"\" JAMA. 2005;294:947-954. Susan J. Lee, JD; Henry J. Peter Ralston, MD; Eleanor A. Drey, MD, EdM; John Colin Partridge, MD, MPH; Mark A. Rosen, MD  With the encouragement of President Ronald Reagan, in 1984 a small group of physicians argued that the ability of a fetus to feel pain appears as early as seven weeks after conception.Robinson, B.A. (2006). Can a fetus feel pain?. Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance. Retrieved December 14, 2005.  Most medical researchers agree pain cannot be felt until the third trimester of pregnancy or until after birth.\"\"Study: Fetus feels no pain until third trimester\"\" MSNBC\\n\\nThere may be an \"\"emerging consensus among developmental neurobiologists that the establishment of thalamocortical connections\"\" (at about 26 weeks) is a critical event with regard to fetal perception of pain.  Nevertheless, because pain can involve sensory, emotional and cognitive factors, it is \"\"impossible to know\"\" when painful experiences may become possible, even if it is known when thalamocortical connections are established.Johnson, Martin and Everitt, Barry.  Essential reproduction (Blackwell 2000): \"\"The multidimensionality of pain perception, involving sensory, emotional, and cognitive factors may in itself be the basis of conscious, painful experience, but it will remain difficult to attribute this to a fetus at any particular developmental age.\"\"  Retrieved 2007-02-21.  According to Arthur Caplan, \"\"there is no consensus among the medical and scientific experts about precisely when a fetus becomes pain-capable.  Some put the point at 28 weeks.

I agree with Gamaliel and Nomoskedasticity that this is a BLP issue and that using \"\"Filipino\"\" alone is utterly unacceptable and POV.   I do think \"\"Filipino-American\"\" correctly describes the subject of the article, and is not an indication of citizenship, but rather it is a demographic description which could accurately be used.  However,  per TheRedPenOfDoom, and MarkBernstein, I think that this may be best handled as Bbb23 and Seb suggested - and how the lead is now worded - which is to not use either identifier in the first sentence, but instead unpack it, spell out in more detail the actual facts in an NPOV manner, in the lead and in the rest of the article which the intro summarizes.  This works and does not take sides in the serious BLP issue.  We further make clear how Vargas self-identifies, which I think is important here, without having Wikipedia editors take a position. As MarkBernstein said, we are not required to indicate nationality or citizenship in the first sentence or anywhere, and TRPoD is right about disclaimers etc.  -sometimes it is best to go at it from a different angle. We also had the same kind of issue at - believe it or not - Bee Gees where there were warring factions who disagreed about whether they should be called English, Australian, or Manx; we handled it by leaving off the nationality, and the wars stopped.   So, I support this wording: Jose Antonio Vargas (born February 3, 1981) is a journalist, filmmaker, and immigration activist.

I don\\'t know if that even applies to everyone or just to the editors under the ban, but I don\\'t really care to be honest... this is out of hand. It\\'s absolutely ridiculous what I-P is turning into on Wikipedia and it is largely a result of this interaction ban which is broken on a nearly daily basis. It is pitting the two \"\"sides\"\" against each other and it has gotten worse than I have ever seen it. The interaction ban is not working; therefore, I hope that you will do something else that can help this situation before it completely falls apart. Here are the newest violations of the interaction ban:\\nI know you are already aware of the post that was made at AN/I. It had a direct mention of Mbz1 by Factomancer through diffs. It was not a complaint about an interaction ban violation on Mbz1\\'s part, so there was no reason for Factomancer to be mentioning Mbz1. You responded at that AN/I and didn\\'t do anything about it, so I guess you didn\\'t consider it a violation for some reason. Maybe because she attempted to strike out and delete the request after the fact? Although personally that makes it worse in my eyes, but clearly I\\'m not the admin. \\nAnyway, past AN/I, she put the same violation on her user page here . It is also a clear violation of WP:UP#POLEMIC. Soon after, she also removed this information, replacing the content with this  stating that she is going on a long break. She has done this before when she has gotten herself into big trouble, only to change her mind after a couple of days and come back. As we can see, her temporary break in that case didn\\'t change her behaviour, as here we are once again.\\nI\\'m truly tired of dealing with this crap. Last year we actually had some sort of collaboration going on in I-P on Wikipedia, before we had to deal with issues like this (to this severity, at least). A combination of a few \"\"new\"\" users coming into the I-P struggle relatively recently have turned it into a real warzone between the two sides, and I don\\'t like it. I don\\'t think other people like it either. It is having an EXTREMELY detrimental effect on the encyclopedia in the I-P area, because not only is so much of our time wasted fighting and defending each other in constant AE and AN/I reports, or sitting out short bans for minor infractions, but even aside from that, it just isn\\'t rewarding or feasible to try to contribute and collaborate anymore. There is no longer an expectation that posting something constructive on a talk page will lead to discussion from people who disagree. There is no point of making significant edits to articles because they are simply followed up by quick reverts, often with no edit summary.\\nI was planning on coming up with some conclusion to this complaint to convince you to take action, but you know what, typically as of late I\\'ve even lost my motivation to do that. I just don\\'t care; it\\'s a waste of time and probably won\\'t get the atmosphere between editors back to what it used to be anyway. The problem is that all you can do (or are willing to do anyway) is impose bans based strictly upon the word of the rules interpreted specifically based on the individual situation. If you took a minute to look at the big picture and understand the impact that certain users are having on the entire I-P editing community with their constant infractions and battles, maybe you would think of a different solution.   \"',\n",

I noticed a page which I honestly felt (and still do) does not meet any of the 12 pts. in WP:MUSIC. I have no interest in their music or their entry. I only noticed them because I took the time to research the type of articles you wrote while nominating mine for deletion. When I looked at them it became obvious that they are non-notable per WP:MUSIC. I nominated the the articles and I then made pertinent comments in that AFD as any nominator would. I never accused you do doing anything surreptitiously, just pointed out that you had an interest in the outcome of the decision beyond simply being the author of the article. I even broached the bad faith subject. If you were conficent that the articles satisfied WP:MUSIC then you should have stated so in a reasoned, sourced, referenced argument and allowed it to stand up to scrutiny. If the consensus was that they met notability standards (beyond your simple assertion that they did) then the articles would have withstood review. I even offered to change my opinion if you could demonstrate notability. Last I heard, \"\"because WebHamster\"\" says so is not a reliable independent source that i am aware of, nor is that stated anywhere on in WP.

It was followed by the report I made at NOR (in which he 1) didn\\'t even try to argue that there was a NOR issue after making the accusation 2) did not apologize to the accused user for the false accusation. Along with discussions at EL, it clearly demonstrates that JSmith was aware there 1) was public opposition both to the project and how it was being conducted, and 2) there was public opposition to how complaints regarding valid links were handled/how other editors were mistreated/community editing was disrespected. In spite of this public opposition, the project, how it was conducted, and how editors with objections/community editing were treated continued unchanged.\\n\\nLet\\'s summarize:\\n\\n1. there was opposition to project itself/how it was conductedthe project began without consensus, against established policy.\\n2. there was oppostion to how users with objections regarding valid links were treated/the disruptive effect this had on community editing at numerous articles.

(Although both are user conduct issues there is no policy dispute. Copyright policy is clear, and they made no attempt to change it/discuss changing it. They cited the EL guideline as standard justification, without consensus, and directly against consensus after it was made clear at EL that no one agreed with a blanket You Tube ban, that links should be evaluated by article editors on a case-by-case basis, via editorial judgement and consensus. The extremely troubling incidents are not the ones in which they deleted suspected copyvios (although there is opposition to that/they do not have consensus and are acting procedurally against both C and EL)the extremely troubling incidents are the ones in which they continued to delete links they KNEW were NOT copyvios,  and how they treated other editors/the community in the process (bullying, false accusations, etcDcmdevit\\'s comments to Argyiou, JSmith\\'s \"\"NOR\"\") and disrupted Wikipedia in violation of WP:POINT.\\n \"',\n",

If you are off \"\"Kanagawa\"\" in Sagami Bay, then Fuji San is to the northwest and Edo (Tokyo) is the to north northeast. The boats are moving to the southeast towards the coast of the Izu peninsula. Because of Fuji San\\'s height above sea level and the reflectivity of snow you do not have to be due east of the mountain to observe a spectacular sun rise. Further confusing the issue, the \"\"Kanagawa\"\" in the title of the print does not refer to Kanagawa Prefecture. Kanagawa Prefecture was established in 1876. Prior to that time, the easternmost part of what is now Kanagawa Prefecture was known as the Province of  Musashi. The westernmost part was known as the province of Sagami. The title may refer to an area in Musashi Province near what is now the city of Yokohama. The problem with this is that you do not see waves of this size in the confined waters of Tokyo Bay. You are only going to see them in Sagami Bay which is consistent with the geography in the print. Perhaps Hokusai was exercising artistic license or perhaps he was reinterpreting something he had heard or been told.

       " \":This has come up several times in the past. This is the background to how it was raised. Bit bored by the topic now and desperately want to focus my wiki time on page creation (see List of Anglo-Saxon saints), but basically there is a tension between the forms you might expect from a superficial reading of UE guidelines, and those used by the reliable sources. Typically those who write articles in the era prefer the latter, while those brought in from process talk pages (like UE) prefer the former. No consensus on the matter has ever come about. Article titles are one thing. Different display titles are useful in different contexts. In monarch lists and more popular pages the anglicized names can be used without much difficulty; however using them in articles like this means departing from the forms used the in WP:RSs used to construct the article (as I can attest as the author) and creating serious issues of cognitive dissonance; compare this to using Gdansk in some eras but Danzig in others. We happened to have modern Anglicized names for Mael Coluim and a few famous kings, but most of the Scottish names used are ones like Garnait, Gille Chlerig and so where there is either no Anglicization or where it is so obscure as to be unhelpful. One of the routine experiences of reading about foreign societies in the distant past are unfamiliar name forms. One masters these and grows (and in any case, only a small minority of these names can ever be anglicized), and in any case I don't seriously believe the claim that 'general reader' will actually be confused. Even GoodDay was able to identify who Mael Coluim IV was.  ()\",\n",

For most applications of tensors to engineering (e.g., rigid body dynamics and stress analysis), it is not necessary to accommodate the general coordinate systems of tensor calculus.  Usually there is some fixed background frame and at worst one needs to know how things transform when that frame is rotated.  Then raising and lowering of indices is also not required, and all of the tensoriality is essentially quite trivial (so suitable for engineers).  It seems to me that this is the intended scope of the article, but it might be helpful if it stated this plainly somewhere, although it is possible that I might have misunderstood what is meant by \"\"rectangular coordinate system\"\".\\n\\nBut assuming that the tensoriality of things is supposed to be trivial here, then the article should not dwell too much on this aspect of things (as it presently does).  The likely audience of the article will only get confused by this, and those looking for a more comprehensive treatment of tensors have other articles to select from.  I think some time should be devoted to discussing examples.  A good one is the inertia tensor and Sylvester\\'s law, in my opinion, because it\\'s very easy to visualize (for instance, in terms of a spinning plate or something).    \"',\n",

Claire Littleton seems to have ben made to substitute for the deceased Danielle Rousseauwas, as the WILD WOMAN of the island. Claire was manipulated and later driven insane (really l-o-o-n-y) by the \"\"Man in Black\"\"; The \"\"Smoke Monster\"\", otherwise revealed as the \\'dead\\' \"\"Christain Sheppard\"\". This is-to say the least-most intriguing, as when \"\"Smokey\"\" attacked Danielle\\'s crew and grusomely killed and then \"\"posessed\"\" her ppl, she went slowly insane.(Smokey didn\\'t kill the young Danielle though it had leisurely opportunity.) The last straw that sent her over the edge was Ben Linus\\'s abduction of her baby daughter. That in itself is a mystery. We know that Ben was ordered to kill the child on orders of Charles Widdmore. Now, here\\'s the mystery: Did Widdmore order Ben to kill the baby on orders of Jacob? Was it Widdmore\\'s own descision, or was Widdmore in league with Jacob, or \"\"Smokey\"\", perhaps in one of his many guises??? And further, though the island seems to have some prohibition against birthed children on its real-estate (the exceptions beng ETHAN ROM and the child saved with Juliet Burke\\'s \"\"miracle\"\" cure, Danielle\\'s baby survives and grows. (How was this possible?) \\n\\n Again, Rousseau was driven insane by \"\"Smokey\"\", but there is no indication that she ever made further contact with the entity in the years since. Upon her and her daughter\\'s murder, shortly afterwards, \"\"Smokey\"\"-using his \"\"Christrian S.\"\" guise-lures Claire away, abandoning her baby, Aaron. Now, this demands explaination, even in the wildcard \"\"logic\"\" of the series. In speaking of \"\"wildcards\"\", did the island always have a crazy wild-woman, even before Rousseau? If it had, then this means that there has always been a purpose for her in configuration to the Jacob\\\\\"\"Smokey\"\" mix. Or, as we who are more rational would surmise, the writers and producers overlooked this fact. It would be in keeping with the Jules Verne novel, \"\"The Castaways\"\". One of the protagonists was a pirate, driven to wildness and insanity, latter playing a pivotal role in the escue of the castaways. \\n\\n The question still begs, what is the purpose of the wild woman (whether Claire, or Danielle)and what is she to the two \"\"masters\"\" of the island? Were both women used as a raging, one-woman guerilla strike-force to constantly harrass and keep in check the \"\"Others\"\", as both have done? (A \"\"control\"\" element, perhaps?) This sounds insane as both \"\"Smokey\"\" and Jacob commissioned the Others as on-the-ground protectors of the island. Were both pawns of Jacob AND \"\"Smokey\"\" in their eternal tug-of-war for dominance? Or, is the wild-woman (either of them)like Hugo, who is somewhat alleged to be insane, given the peculiar grace to see and communicate with Jacob, and altenately with the monster, especially when the latter is in a more quiesent, non-murderous state? \\n\\n veryverser Veryverser\"',\n",

Furthermore, the United States has continually denounced Argentinian repression in international forums, whereas the Soviet Union has come to their defense....Argentina has played a vital role in sabotaging the grain embargo on the Soviet Union.\"\"  Here\\'s another:  \"\"Argentina has redirected its normal pattern of trade to a greater extent than any of the other grain exporters in 1979.  Pursuing an aggressive marketing strategy after abolishing its Grain Board some time before, the government allowed its companies to replace all the U.S. orders they could. It reduced customary exports to Italy, Spain, Japan, Chile, and Peru, selling nearly all of its exportable corn and grain sorghum surplus to the Soviet Union. In return, it received prices of almost 25 cents over the American selling price from the desparate Soviet foreign trade organization responsible for grain imports, Export Khleb. In addition, Export Khleb wooed Argentina into an agreement to sell 20 million tons of corn and grain sorghum, and 2.5 million tons of soybeans to the Soviets over the next five years. The Soviet Vice Minister of Foreign Trade even predicted in April a tripling of total trade between the USSR and Argentina in the next few years.\"\"  And another: \"\"This poor harvest did not prevent Argentina from expanding its grain exports to the Soviet Union.\"\"  And  another:  \"\"Soviet propaganda and other support for Argentina during the South Atlantic war contrasted favorably in Argentine eyes with US support for the United Kingdom.\"\"  \"',\n",

There\\'s just no numerical way to determine \"\"most common,\"\" and while my mere impression is that ancient historians and classicists of the last 30 years do not call him \"\"Julian the Apostate\"\" as if that\\'s his name, and that this is a holdover from more Christian-centric days, you can\\'t \"\"prove\"\" it and it\\'s a waste of everybody\\'s time to attempt to do so. Numerically, you\\'ll get a lot of hits because even if a scholar doesn\\'t call him \"\"Julian the Apostate,\"\" the tradition of that name must be explained in any extended treatment of Julian. My chief argument against \"\"Julian the Apostate\"\" as \"\"most common\"\" is that \"\"apostate\"\" itself is an uncommon word: if you grab 50 people at your local mall and ask them if they\\'ve heard of either \"\"Julian the Apostate\"\" or \"\"the Emperor Julian,\"\" you\\'ll probably get a stronger glint of recognition with the \"\"Emperor\"\" phrase, simply because most people know what a Roman emperor is and not what an \"\"apostate\"\" is. As far as I know, Julian is the only emperor who\\'s identified with a title not part of his official nomenclature. Since \"\"Julian the Apostate\"\" would of course redirect here, I don\\'t see the value of WP promulgating a tendentious nickname instead of following our usual naming policy as outlined in WP:ROMANS. There are, however, people who feel very strongly that we should perpetuate \"\"the Apostate\"\" for reasons that are unclear to me, but valid to them.   \"',\n",

[reply to my email address asteconnathotmaildotcom, this IP address is my work\\'s one =] thanks ]  \\n\\n Episode naming \\n\\nHi, Cyberia.  There\\'s actually been a lot of discussion about this subject at Wikipedia:Naming conventions (television) and its talk page.  The consensus of most of the editors there is that articles should be disambiguated only when it\\'s necessary — that is, when there\\'s no other article by that name.  This is why, for example, Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down was moved to that location from Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down (Battlestar Galactica) — there is no other article that could be at that page.  This is in keeping with the general disambiguation guidelines at WP:D, specifically WP:D#Deciding to disambiguate, which says:\\nAsk yourself: When a reader enters this term and pushes \"\"Go\"\", what article would they most likely be expecting to view as a result? (For example, when someone looks up Joker, would they find information on a comedian? On a card? On Batman\\'s nemesis? On the hit song or album by The Steve Miller Band?) When there is no risk of confusion, do not disambiguate nor add a link to a disambiguation page.\\nThe argument you give (that using parenthetical phrases consistently keeps articles consistent and makes them easier to identify) has been considered in the debate at WT:TV-NC, but most editors felt that the \"\"consistency\"\" was a misleading virtue, since preemptive disambiguation actually makes articles less consistent with the general Wikipedia naming scheme.  And the article itself should provide enough context to identify it.  The category system also unites articles on a similar topic.\\n\\nThe Star Trek precedent is, in my opinion, a bad one; the editors at the Star Trek WikiProject have been informed of the discussion at WT:TV-NC, and it is likely that Star Trek episode articles will also be moved soon.\\n\\nI admit that Resurrection Ship and Cylon resurrection ship are a slightly complicated case, but I think that since the episode is titled Resurrection Ship (with a capital \"\"S\"\") and the ship itself is at Cylon resurrection ship (with no capitals), it\\'s sufficiently clear.  However, if you and other BSG editors feel that it\\'s better to have Resurrection ship as a disambiguation page, with the episode at Resurrection Ship (Battlestar Galactica episode) and the ship at Cylon resurrection ship, that would be OK too. — (talk • contribs) \\n\\nIt\\'s been considered.  See the extensive discussion at WT:TV-NC and its archives, especially here. Basically, the argument is that disambiguation isn\\'t about identifying a subject unless there are two articles that might otherwise share the same name.  So it\\'s appropriate for \"\"The Enemy Within\"\" to be disambiguated The Enemy Within (TOS episode), since there are other meanings of The Enemy Within (disambiguation).  But there\\'s no need for Charlie X to be disambiguated, since only the TOS episode has that name. — (talk • contribs) \\nJosiah means \"\"some\"\" editors.. 50% does not equate to \"\"most\"\" Josiah. \\xa0(talk contribs count\"',\n",

Wikipedia, on the other hand, is explicitly not a dictionary.

       " '\"This comment is a classic straw man argument meant to misrepresent the side that wishes not to include the questions and answers to the test.  The author writes \"\"But we have to decide whether we believe in a society where most people are only allowed to know some few things that more enlightened heads decide are useful enough to them to justify any potential dangers and social problems they might create.\"\" Of course I and psychologists would agree that most people should not be forced to know only \"\"some few things!\"\"  The problem is that Mike Serfas provides a false misrepresentation of what the minority wants.  We do not want \"\" society where most people are only allowed to know some few things.\"\"  We want a very narrow and specific limitation - no cheat sheets (questions and answers) to tests that are used to help people. Other than test questions and answers the more encyclopedic information the better! Is that clear enough? We do not advocate that \"\"only psychologists know psychology\"\" as falsely claimed, only that test questions and test answers ought not be leaked.  It\\'s as simple and limited as that. Leaked questions and answers to psychology tests make articles on those tests no more encyclopedic than leaked questions and answers on the SAT or some other test would make articles on those subjects \"\"encyclopedic.\"\" A \"\"democratic sense of equality\"\" brought about by leaking  psych tests is no different than one for medical licensing exams (\"\"why shouldn\\'t everybody be able to practice medicine? let\\'s leak all the questions ans answers...\"\"), etc.  \\n\\nWhen you leak the test questions and test answers to a history test you rob that test of its purpose: to examine how well students have learned history.  A history teacher objecting to leaking this information does not wish that history remain a secret known only to him (on the contrary!).  He just wants to be able to tell how well his students have learned and it\\'s much harder for this to be done if he can\\'t use a test to do it.  Similarly, when you leak the questions and answers to a medical licensing exam, you rob that exam of its ability to test whether or not people are qualified to practice medicine. This makes it much harder to determine whether or not someone is qualified.  The purpose of the Rorschach is help the psychologist make accurate diagnoses in order to help people and society. Mr. Serfas\\' statement that \"\"is no consensus even among psychologists that the test is useful\"\" is absolutely false.  There is some controversy between a small group of psychologists led by James Wood and the majority over whether or not it is overused but even Wood, the Rorschach\\'s main opponent, states that the test is not worthless (see this article. This controversy can be adequately described (and ought to be) in the article without including the tests\\' \"\"cheat sheet\"\" (its questions and answers). Even Wood states that the Rorschach is good at detecting thought disorder. Thus, by posting its questions and answers it becomes more difficult to accurately diagnose thought disorder; a tool for doing so has ben compromised.  People might be given pills for it that they otherwise would not have been given, or conversely not be treated for something they have.  Most psychologists would welcome a lot of encyclopedic information about the Rorschach in the article.  It would be useful to dispell some of the scary myths about the tests, etc.  They object to including information about the test.  Just not the test\\'s questions and answers.      \\n\\nSo no, psychologists on this forum are not monsters lurking in lairs, or a secret society doing unknown and scary things which must be exposed, which is the picture you and others seem to be trying to paint. They\\'re just people defending a test used to help people which, like most tests, gets damaged if the questions and answers are leaked all over the internet. It\\'s rather difficult to engage in a dialogue when the other side misrepresents the minority position to such a huge degree, and then others vote or make decisions against this minority based on the misrepresentations rather than the actual position.  I hope that this has cleared things up for you and others.\\n\\nSome people have claimed that psychologists and others want to bring back the \"\"dark ages\"\" by not having questions and answers to tests on this page. I invite you to consider if maybe there is some of that going on on the other side?  There was a time when \"\"common sense\"\" indicated that it was ridiculous that people were descended from monkeys. The science, backed up by thousands of studies, is clear that the Rorschach works - but \"\"common sense\"\" tells some people unfamiliar with it that the idea that what is seen in inkblots can tell you something about that person is ridiculous. Or that some kind of \"\"magic\"\" is involved (scientists were once accused of witchcraft).',\n",

If you do not understand this fact then why was the Wikipedia African Diaspora project initiated? You should have called it the Black Anglo Saxon Diaspora Project instead.

It\\'s been extremely rare up to now (maybe once or twice in 2000+ maps) that there already is one there, and those weren\\'t standard Dot Project maps. I believe I left them alone and also added a standard Dot Project map. \\n\\n As far as I know, no one has asked until now to do only some communities in a state, but I\\'ve expected it would occur eventually. The Dot Project is a big task and only a few of us have tackled it. I\\'ve done Missouri, Arizona, and Ohio, and am pretty far along on Louisiana. After that, I would like to do Kansas and then, I\\'ll probably stop, at least for awhile. If you would like to do maps for Louisiana and/or Kansas, I guess I\\'d welcome the assistance. \\n\\n It would be nice in such a collaboration to have a way to find what maps have been generated for a state (eg \\'show me all instances of \"\"LAMap*.png\"\"\\'), but I understand that we can\\'t query for images this way in Wikipedia. If you\\'re only doing a few in each state, the way I create my images isn\\'t very time-consuming. Hitting one occasionally wouldn\\'t be a bother. I usually generate them alphabetically by county/parish, getting all the cities, towns and unincorporated areas in a county/parish before moving on to the next. If you were going to focus on the larger cities, that would work too, as I could preview them easily enough. If it was \\'scatter-shot\\', it would be nice if you could leave a list in some logical place. I could then scratch the completed ones from my to-do list. \\n\\n Of course, I don\\'t speak for Seth. Outside of Louisiana and Kansas, what happens with the Dot Project might not affect me. I\\'ll be interested in seeing Seth\\'s response to your question.   \\n\\n == September 11, 2001 attacks Revisions == \\n\\n Hi! \\n Thanks for taking notice and reverting the changes I made to the 9/11 attacks page.

This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, were it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.\\n\\nSo a few things about the interviews:\\n Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.\\n Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)\\n All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.\\n All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.\\n The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.\\n\\nBottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.\\n\\nIf you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.\\n\\nThanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nJonathan Obar\",\n",

Nathaniel, I think you have pointed out one of the most fascinating double edges of the internet, and certainly this frustrating Wikipedia. (please forgive me taking this time here, but for the sake of your welding article case, might I be so bold to attempt advancing a much, much larger cause as well) \\n\\nYou have said yourself, that you are not a highly experienced \"\"welder\"\", save for I\\'m sure at least some time spent laying down a few good beads, yet you haven\\'t been known to build large constructions where lives might have depended?  I have that right about you, yes?  \\n\\nHOWEVER, what you have done through this string of welding articles, I find simply fantastic.  It is concise and worded at a level properly aimed at most anyone already competent enough to begin welding, yet simply needs to get the overview.  It is as authoritative as any single, or group of books and articles I\\'ve read on welding as a hole. (That should encourage, and scare you at the same time). Now we just need to add a bit more about the Art.  Yes, that ethereal bane stalking wikipedia bureaucrats who can\\'t stand things which don\\'t come up in google counts.\\n\\nThe list of unsourced statements you have offered, may exist in no small part, to the very lack of \"\"authoritative\"\" sources available for such things.  I have never, NEVER come across two welding books which are consistent through a \"\"school of thought\"\" on such a list of interdependent items.  It is precisely the effect of deep interrelation, that no two instructors will ever approach welding exactly the same, yet \\'miraculously\\' so many welds hold together and perform their needed functions in our lives.  After the instructor has pointed out the canvas, paints and brushes, than he must leave the student to his own devices.  To hone a skill set, to practice an art.  Practice.  For ultimately, the welders experience becomes the most reliable gauge to deciding the finished quality of a weld.  So practice and time under the hood is everything \"\"so they say\"\".  \\n\\nX-Ray is really quite impractical for all but the most over-funded projects.  Destruction, by cross-cutting open the weld or simply trying to break it, is what the most honest instructor will tell a student he must do if he wants to know (learn) what it takes to make a good weld.  Breaking things, is the engineeres absolute best instruction manual, and he/she must hold in great regard and memory, those times where they witnessed failure, so better to prevent it.  That is what truly builds experience, and it is only the experienced person who has any hope of mastering any art.\\n\\nA highly technical, well sourced, and cited article such as this, MUST in some way acknowledge that the details will only go so far before it must address that which I have seen turn the stomach of so many a geekzoid wikipedian.....   those chanting the endless mantra of NPOV and that shit-source of false surety, google counts; That there are people out there who know more than google.  And there always will be.  That these articles, if wikipedia wishes to survive, if wikipedia ever wishes to be more than an ARTIFICIAL intelligence, it must learn to allow by tolerance alone of need be, or better yet, to encourage those who have deep knowledge into feeling more comfortable here.  To collaborate, to offer their thoughts and experience here, to celebrate the diversity of opinion, and even the how-tos and what-fors wherein work can be done with great satisfaction and supreme result, for all.\\n\\nThis largely tedious, wasteful, foolhardy, and pointless absolute fixation around which too many wikipedians have styled themselves as NPOV warriors, by demanding citation on every minute single detail, will be this wiki\\'s undoing.   \\n\\nFrom my experience, the arc is held simply as short as possible so as to concentrate heat in the shortest possible time, yet long enough to avoid dipping the tip while the hand naturally shakes minutely.  The amount of heat, the amount of heat the power-supply can deliver (over time, and becomes and very important factor in calculating \"\"duty-cycle\"\") to the weld pool, and thus how convex or concave the pool is laid with filler, defines (for me) how close I can get to the work.  Duty Cycle, is a calculation of the machines ability to deliver a given heat, for a given time, vs. the time it must literally rest idle before it has radiated or cooled the internal workings of the machine, completely irrespective of the work piece. Yet this largely defines the maximum amount of heat, to a given thickness, in a \\'shortness\\' of time that a welder can put into the work piece.  Aluminum for example is notorious for its ability to \"\"wick\"\" (conduct) heat away from the p',\n",

That impulse has left me, and I make the promise that it will not return. I do not retract anything that I said. The bigger issue which I have been addressing is the flaw within the system itself. After repeated requests to actually read what I\\'m saying here and what I actually said on the Beat Generation page, you clearly have mistunderstood me. Your claim that you have ignored evidence in the prosecution of my punishment is one among many disturbing signs of the flaws within the Wikipedia system. What you call extraneous issues are indeed central issues. You have done little to convince me otherwise. For example, the sockpuppetry was a bad idea when considering rules of civility, and I won\\'t let it happen again. It was a good idea in that it was funny, but like I said, that\\'s out of my system. The bigger issue  a central issue, not extraneous  is that admins claimed I was being dishonest. This is evidence of laziness and lack of real concern for the real job you are meant to do. If the real problem is that I was uncivil, then I apologize and make an honest promise that I will never do it again. I don\\'t believe that really is a central issue. I\\'m not blaming anyone else for me being uncivil; I chose to do it and have never claimed otherwise. The problem is Wikipedia is a toilet. Why is it a toilet? Wikipedia is a punchline. Why is it a punchline? Because people who passionately care about truth get angry (even if it was pretend) on occassion? No. I realize uncivil behavior can be a contributing factor in that it can fail to lead to a positive change; I was practically begging for a positive change on the Beat Generation page, and nothing was happening. Certain other editors were relying on Wikipedia rules to stymie progress. Block me or don\\'t block me, I don\\'t care (and judging from the history of this process and my history with Tao  I fear you\\'ll scan this for trigger words, see \"\"I don\\'t care\"\" and say, \"\"If you don\\'t care, why are you wasting my time?\"\" totally missing the point of what I\\'m actually saying)  but please look in the mirror and think about the real problem here. If you skip the first part where I genuinely apologize for the actual infraction and said I would never do it again (just as I genuinely apologized for the infraction last time and said I would never do it again  and I can keep saying this over and over again) and if you once again just look at this part and claim I\\'m focusing on extraneous issues and incorrectly claim that I\\'m blaming others  blaming others for my rant? no, please actually see: my rant is my responsibility, and once again I apologize for it  whatever you do, despite my lack of faith in anyone\\'s ability to genuinely take some time and think about these things, please just consider what\\'s right and what\\'s wrong here on a larger level while in the short term focusing on my genuine heart-felt apology.

I take it that you are objecting to my using the word \"\"vandalism\"\" in some recent edits, though.  What I meant by the term was the punitive nature of recent edits at random, unrelated articles by another editor, in lieu of discussion.  There has been, I thought, consensus that the other editor and I and others would discuss four CT NRHP articles, and not engage in edit warring at hundreds of other articles that have the same issues.  It seems like vandalism to me, to see an outbreak of edit warring at random other articles.  I even defined what i meant by my use of the term, in an edit summary at Wyoming, Rhode Island: \"\"(Undid undo apparent vandalism (edit warring apparently related to Talk:Poquetanuck)\"\", while at the corresponding Wyoming Village Historic District \\u200eI just wrote it shorter \"\"(Undid Undo apparent vandalism)\"\".  But, looking at wp:vandalism now, I see that in wikipedia jargon, vandalism seems to be given a specific meaning that is not what I meant.  In the sequence of my edits, and given the general discussion at Talk pages which I am participating, I don\\'t expect that the other editor would misunderstand what i was saying in shorthand in these or other edit summaries.  I don\\'t know what other short term would do, instead.  Anyhow, if the term is such a third rail as the wp:vandalism guideline describes, i will try to avoid using the term in the future.    \\n\\n :::Once again, any attempt at movement is blocked by Polaron who is content with the status quo and therefore does not engage in any meaningful attempt to remedy the situation, but just blocks and refuses to make any movement.

       " '\" \\n\\n (Zapletal Writes ->) Mark, Your last sentence pretty much nails it (in terms of this simplified \"\"billiard ball\"\" model...). \\n\\n For an even simpler version, consider an aerofoil moving at constant horizontal velocity through a vacuum, and above a large massive body such as the Earth. The gravity force between Earth and foil pulls them together, and gives them both equal time-rate-of-change of inwards momenta (ie. d(m.V)). Of course, the lighter foil has the higher dV here, so follows a more curved path (roughly parabolic, concave down). Now picture something like a football bouncing up and down \"\"elastically\"\" (!) between the two bodies. Each time it hits the Earth and bounces back up, it \"\"exchanges\"\" twice its vertical linear momentum with the Earth, and gives it some downward dP (but of very tiny dV). Similarly, each time it hits the underside of the foil and bounces back down, it gives the foil the same upward momentum dP. So answer to your original question is, indeed, YES. End result is that the foil travels along a path a bit like \"\"mmm\"\". \\n\\n The bouncing ball in this model is roughly equivalent to Lanchester\\'s \"\"pillar\"\" from page 9 of his book, ie.,  \"\"As a whole, the fluid, in the previous section, does not gain or lose momentum any more than does a cast-iron pillar supporting a load.\"\" . \\n\\n Adding more detail to the model has many more balls bouncing every which way, which add, in Continuum Mechanics terms, an \"\"ambient pressure\"\" everywhere. But, for this BB model to work there MUST be a time-averaged increase in the number of these balls bouncing between each other in the zone between the Earth and foil. This \"\"increased pressure zone\"\" MUST ALSO travel steadily with the foil, much as the single football does above, or as does Lanchester\\'s \"\"cast-iron pillar\"\". (End Zapletal)  \"',\n",

Headbomb\\'s edits are purely destructive. He has added no information to the article; he has simply deleted information, and that while introducing illiteracies and incoherencies.\\n\\n He also has issued bizarrely false statements about his edits, such as stating that \"\"Tipler is not known for either the \\'purported physical proof of God\\' nor any recognized quantum theory of gravity/TOE.\"\" Yet that\\'s what the only two sections in the \"\"Academic work\"\" section state that Prof. Tipler is known for claiming.\\n\\n Along with the deletion of the links to free book chapters (of which edits had previously been reverted by the Wikipedia administrator Irishguy), the pattern of Headbomb\\'s edits show a clear intent to damage the article due to Headbomb\\'s ideological dislike of Prof. Tipler and his work, of which is further reinforced by the personal information on Headbomb\\'s user page. That is, Headbomb is attempting to get rid of information that would be helpful for others to learn more about Tipler and his work (such as the links to free book chapters; and the infobox \"\"Known for\"\" field which, in the useful form in which I had it, would quickly let people know what Tipler is known for claiming: whereas listing books names and the Omega Point Theory\\'s name would only make sense to someone if they already knew of them, and so they are either purely redundant or unhelpful; etc).\\n\\n Whereas I have an actual history of adding value to this article by writing most of the article\\'s text, adding sections, and adding most of the references. I don\\'t point out this fact as a claim of ownership over the articleunlike Headbomb, who has effectively argued to the effect that the supposed \"\"hard work\"\" of his illiterate and destructive edits entitles him to keep the article the way he edited itbut rather to point out that I am actually literate and competent, and that I actually care about making it easier for people to learn about the subject of the article; unlike Headbomb\\'s illiterate and incoherent edits, which get rid of highly useful information in order to make it harder for people to learn about the article\\'s subject.\\n\\n The article was doing fine until Headbomb came along.

And a book written in such a hotspot is sure to generate numerous quotes, misquotes, dubious translation and out-of-context statements. As per WP:BLP I think it stands to reason that a more conservative and less sensationalist translation be used, and for the same reason, the quotes should not be taken out of the context that the book uses them in.\\n\\nWith than in mind on the 18th of February, I improved certain parts of the paragraph in question in order to make to make it more compatible with WP:BLP based on this source.\\n\\nuser:Zero0000 -  responded to one of my edits by stating that [en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yitzchak_Ginsburgh&diff;=538816167&oldid;=538810305 I \"\"can\\'t read.\"\"] And in what seemed to be extremely inappropriate comment for a Wikipedia administrator, told me in as many words to get off Wikipedia.\"\"Take a break\"\" I didn\\'t take nicely to being told that by an administrator and thus began a heated series of exchanges during which I was told by said individual that I had \"\"behavioral problems.\"\"\\nSaid individual also decided to respond to my comments by invoking what seemed to me to intimidation tactics \"\"I started to write a complaint against you\"\" (why do I need to know that? He can let me know when he posts it) and then later responding to another edit he didn\\'t like by saying that \"\"it was on my charge sheet.\"\"\\n\\nNow the reason I am writing about the behavior of said individual is to give some context or the 1RR issue:\\nAfter posting my version of the paragraph, user:Zero0000 subsequently changed it to this.\\n\\nI will post only the first few words of his statement and the source:\\n\\nSource: \"\"There is a reason to kill babies [on the enemy side\"\"]\\n\\nuser:Zero0000: [\"\"Babies [on the enemy side may be killed .\"\"]\\n\\nAfter those first few words, user:Zero0000 continues quoting the rest of the paragraph. Now at best this is a serious distortion. \\n\\nAnd when you consider that article is dealing with a scholarly work which contains hundreds of sometimes competing, sometimes contradictory sources, rationales, theories, proposals, and ideas; many of which are subsequently discounted, limited in scope, or just tossed by the wayside, the disparity the statement \"\"may be done\"\" and \"\"there is a reason\"\" is even greater.\\n\\nAside from the distortion mentioned above, in contradiction to WP:BLP user:Zero0000 also opted for a particularly liberal out-of-context translation.\\n\\nWhy did user:Zero0000 replace my edit with his own. His statement:\\n(prefer source with an actual quotation)\\n\\nAs I showed above, he didn\\'t use an actual quotation.\\n\\nFurthermore, after seeing his comment, I searched but wasn\\'t able to find any Wikipedia reference to a such a preference, leading me to believe that he was intent on just superimposing his own WP:JUSTDONTLIKEIT on me without explanation. \\n\\nHis actions above combined with the general hostility cited above led me to be believe that this was another front in the multi-pronged campaign of intimidation that he was engaging in (i.e. encouraging me \"\"take a break\"\").NEWLIN',\n",

It is a fact that there is no published evidence showing that wearing red string works.  As I said- it really doesn't matter if someone believes in red string or not- you can't deny that there is no evidence to support this belief.  If people wish- they can choose to believe in the powers of a piece of red string- that is a matter of faith.  However if they want to claim that there is empirical support for this belief then they should be able to source it.  Similarly, I think it's perfectly relevant to state that there is no scientific/historical support for the claimed ressurection of Jesus.  I'm not being skeptical here- I'm being realistic.  To the extent that skeptics adhere to factual views then I side with them when it comes to editing an encyclopedia.  I am not criticizing anyone's faith.\",\n",

A (barely) simplified version of the formula for this discussion is: Number of Decisions * Average Bet * House Edge = Expected Value.  On a single number, single spin bet of $1 as the table suggests the EV according to that formula is 1 (decision) * 1 (bet) * 0.053 (edge, rounded) = $0.053.  For 10,000 spins at $1 the EV is $530 meaning the casino wins $530 as stated.  \\n\\nTo determine the player's edge for a straight up bet take the chances of winning (1/38) multiplied by the payout (35) plus the chances of losing (37/38) multiplied by the loss (-1).  (1/38 * 35) + (37/38 * -1) = -0.05263 or a loss of $0.05263 per dollar bet.  If you do the math this is the same edge for any double-zero wheel bet except for the top line.  As a random side note, to quickly determine the payout for any combination of numbers: 36/(numbers bet) - 1 = payout.

For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including “BlackPearl14\"\", “SVTCobra”, “Chris Mann” and “Whoville” own Disney stock, have gone to any Disney theme park, watch Disney movies and/or buy Disney products?   Then “BlackPearl14\"\", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including “BlackPearl14\"\", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” don’t sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including “BlackPearl14\"\", “SVTCobra” and “Whoville” together claim “conflict of interest” and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of “conflict of interest” and “neutral”.\\n\\nWikipedia and Wikinews editors don\\'t follow Wikinews\\' own written polices... “Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?”. Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia\\'s own written polices, and such. \\n\\nWikinews and wikipedia allows editors “fans” to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they don’t approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It\\'s against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete \"\"when in doubt don\\'t delete\"\" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you don’t abide by wikinews and wikipedia’s own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop tell the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..

They certainly were no more severe than \"\"small-scale vandalism\"\": \"\"For instance, one user gratuitously insulting another user, while inappropriate, is not disruptive.  Neither is simple small-scale vandalism.\"\"  They then follow up with an example quite similar to what happened with your block of LC:  \"\"Furthermore, don\\'t cause actual disruption in an effort to fix a perceived disruption. An excellent example of this is the Great Userbox War of 2006; several users who claimed userboxes were disruptive, set about deleting and trying to stop further creation of such userboxes. The ensuing fight was orders of magnitude more disruptive than any supposed disruption for which the userbox opponents were able to provide evidence. Just because you don\\'t like something doesn\\'t mean it is disruption. Disruption is a large-scale hindrance of Wikipedia\\'s ability to function, whether technically, administratively, or socially.

I finished reading Hancock\\'s book a couple of months ago and I don\\'t remember Hancock being sure or dogmatic about anything.  I would be surprised if Hancock does that.   \\n\\n :PV, what I think you\\'re missing is that Hancock (and probaly JAH) is merely offering what he thinks MAY have happened and he offers evidence (not \"\"proof\"\") to back up his reconstruction, so I\\'m still not sure why you\\'re so angry.  I have no problem with people being passionate, but Deb is right regarding your tone.    \"',\n",

Switches either seperate collision domains or eliminate them entirely so this isn\\'t a problem on a switch based network. Eventually the delays would build up to the point where higher level protocols started to time out but the network would have to get huge for that to happen with most protocols.\\nPractically there are several other troublesome factors. One is that switches rely on storing the mac addresses of every machine on the lan to decide where to send packets. If there are too many machines for the switches to store the switches will \"\"fail open\"\" and end up broadcasting traffic they don\\'t know where to send to the whole network. Furthermore being a tree network a lot of traffic will tend to cluster on the center of the tree (the impact of this can be reduced by making those parts of the network higher speed or by using techniques like port trunking).\"',\n",
